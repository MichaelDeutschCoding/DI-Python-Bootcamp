            Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the batting team is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing it to run the basesâ€”having its runners advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate. The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.

    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>Baseball is played over the course of nine innings, which consist of two halves (referred to as the top half and bottom half) in which each team gets a chance to bat and score as many runs as they can before recording three outs. Play may continue as long as it takes, this being one of the distinctive characteristics of the game. There is no clock.</p>

            <h3>Similarities</h3>
            <p>Baseball is similar to cricket in that they both have "innings" (in cricket this term is always used in the plural, in baseball it is not.) There is no clock in either, and games can continue for a very long time. They both utilize a defensive team who cannot score, but try to record outs.</p>

            <h3>Differences</h3>
            <p>There are a number of key differences between the two sports. In cricket there are only two stumps, and the batsmen try to run back and forth between them. As opposed to the four bases in baseball. Baseball only has one hitter on the field at any given time.</p>
